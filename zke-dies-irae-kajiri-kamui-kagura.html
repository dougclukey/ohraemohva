                            <p>Has anyone played these games? I recently finished playing Kajiri Kamui Kagura, and wished that I had played Dies Irae because there were so many references to it. Curious about your opinions. So about 8 months ago I made a list of fan-made discords specifically for visual novel communities. I wanted to expand that list to include discords by official licensing companies as well as subreddits. ---- List of active visual novel related subreddits Clannad - https://www.reddit.com/r/Clannad/ Dies Irae - https://www.reddit.com/r/DiesIrae/ Doki Doki Literature Club - https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC Eroge (All 18+ Content) - https://www.reddit.com/r/eroge/ Fate/Stay Night.

So I finished Dies Irae, It had its flaws but it was so damn enjoyable. From the mind-blowing action scenes to the amazing cast of characters, I enjoyed it so much. I realized that I will never be able to experience something like this again, at least not until Kajiri Kamui Kagura gets translated (fingers crossed). But I wanted to know what other action VNs are out here? VNs known for their amazing action and fight scenes? amp#x200B. Kajiri Kamui Kagura  Dies irae & WORLD BOX ~Masada Premium~. ~~Because we totally needed one of these threads.~~ Because I'm OCD, I divided my backlog into three sections, translated VNs, untranslated VNs with a English translation in the works and untranslated VNs (because I'm a filthy EOP, apparently). Also, I won't be linking VNDB because holy fuck that would take forever. __________________________________________________ #Tier 1: Procrastination is one hell of a drug Higurashi Rewrite Sekien no Inganock Shikkoku no Sharnoth Yukizakura.
