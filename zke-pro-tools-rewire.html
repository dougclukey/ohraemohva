Hi guys! I recently recorded an artist and had to use reaper for it. Now I want to export all takes from the tracks to edit them in ProTools because I have way more options there. I just don't know how to do it. I can't even get the takes on new seperate tracks  Explode on new tracks doesn't do anything for me and exporting the stems is not right for me either.

ReWire devices are only scanned when the DigiReWire plugin is scanned (which typically happens. Two questions: When I record audio, such as guitar to the metronome in Ableton, does it automatically change it any to fit the grid? I ask this because I notice that it automatically turns warp on. Since my timing is pretty good, it's hard for me to hear one way or another. I could zoom in and analyze it but I figured I'd ask here since I had another question I wanted to ask anyway. My second question; I am getting ready to record an EP. Most of it is not electronic, most of it is guitar DarkWave Studio — полностью бесплатный мультитрековая виртуальная студия для создания электронной музыки и редактирования звуковых файлов.

Every time, after I scan the vocal, I hear these little popping and clicking noises as soon as I edit anything on the vocals. I realized that whenever I mess with the note tolerance that it effects how often the pops and clicks happen in between. It's not a buffer issue or a case of me using too many plugins. It ONLY happens after I scan and start to edit the vocal using that plugin. Has anybody else experienced.

Im running Reason (10.0.3) in ReWire mode inside Pro Tools (12.8.3) via a stereo Aux track, and any notes I record get cut off during playback. I know this is a known issue when there are duplicate controllers, but I've ensured this is not my problem, as everything plays fine when I run reason in stand-alone mode. I do have a different session of Pro Tools with Reason running inside of it where I don't have this issue, but I cannot seem to figure out why its happening in one session 
Reason rewire not working in PT12 Pro Tools 12 . Yes PT12 and Reason are 64 bit but Reason Hi everyone. I have been composing and arranging music for a few years now. I started with MuseScore and then later Sibelius, so I'm used to constructing my music by writing the sheet music. But I want a better sound. I want to have control over the volume of each individual note, the reverb, and the expression. So I'm wondering about DAWs. From what I know, it starts with importing a MIDI and then loading a VST. I also want to know about any hardware I would need to make music like this. Using ReWire, Pro Tools First can send and receive MIDI to and from a ReWire client application, such as a software synthesizer, and receive audio back from the ReWire client. Hi, I have a launchpad mini which isn't natively compatible with pro tools 12. Though I've heard stories that with some software like Rewire or Automap you may get it to work.

Hope this is the right place, I'll go look for a Sibelius sub but it feels more a PT question. What I'm trying to do is run Sibelius Brand new Reason user here (v8) and fairly well-versed in Pro Tools 10 amp 11. Shouldn't it be pretty straight-forward to have my MIDI tracks in PT fire live from Reason? Do I not just add Reason ReWire and configure it? It does not show up in plugins. I've gone thru the 32/64 bit jazz. It's all set to 64. I do have Waves ReWire which I think came with Waves Tune. Is that in the way? Do I dump it? Anyway I am a n00b on this part so any help is much appreciated. Join Rick Schmunk for an in-depth discussion in this video Use ReWire with Pro Tools, part of Finale 2014 Essential Training. Been using Pro Tools for a long time, just started using Ableton as a ReWire slave to play with it's capabilities auditioning/warping loops. The situation is I have my playhead in Pro Tools at say bar 30, go to Ableton, find a loop I like, put it on the track then launch it. When I stop that loop and return to Pro Tools, the playhead marker has returned to wherever the Ableton insertion marker might be (default to the start of the session) as opposed to where I left it at bar 30 in Pro Tools.

To make a long story short, the Reason bassline amp synth doesn't want to export/bounce down along with the rest of the track. I was wondering what i need to do to correct this. I'm obviously not some advanced-MIDI genius amp I rarely use MIDI besides some of it's capabilities that I don't even have to think about. Again, I don't The Possibilities Are Endless  For me — a die-hard Pro Tools user and electronic/hip-hop producer — ReWire has become an essential part of my everyday workflow.

Hello my fine friends. I'm a longtime Pro Tools dude and though I love it, I think its time for me to branch out and get a new DAW and I'm really considering Logic Pro X. The automation in pro tools leaves a lot to be desired, and that's a big thing for me. I do have a few questions! 1. Can you run Logic Pro without an audio interface connected? Like, can you at least get into your session and listen to it/edit it a bit without having to plug in your USB audio interface? Producing Get the sound you want with these audio plugins offered in Pro Tools.  Stream audio and MIDI to and from Pro Tools and other ReWire client applications + + + Signal Generator. Calibrate audio interfaces and other studio gear with this test tone generator. OSX 10.9 is my operating system btw. I recently updated to reason 7 and now I can't get it to work in Pro Tools 10 with Rewire, which is how I use it. I know that Reason 7 is 64bit and PT 10 is 32bit, so they aren't compatible. So I made it so Reason only opens in 32bit mode, but still don't see Reason as a pro tools plug in. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So. let's do this: Cubase: Probably the most professional-feeling daw I ever used. Very sober. Good for tracking and recording. Also good for building stuff from the ground up, tho not as easy/fast as I would like. FL: As their slogan once was: The fastest way from your brain to your speakers. Indeed. FL is hands down the easiest way for you to lay down melodies/record. Troubleshooting ReWire issues.

I've looked into Fast Track and the M-Box. Both come with Pro Tools LE. While I was on the Avid website I saw I could get Pro Tools 10 for 0 since I am a student. However this does not come with an audio interface. I would not be able to afford the M-box and Pro Tools 10. Pro Tools 10 and Fast track a good idea for a beginner? Thanks.

Hey guys, I'm coming from /r/ableton and I have some quick questions. I've used Pro Tools a few years ago and then fell in love with Ableton for production.
